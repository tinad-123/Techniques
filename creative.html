           <h1> Experiences Develop Creativity </h1>
           <p>
            
            Artists develop creativity from experiences. The more experiences you have, both as an artist and as a human, the more ideas will flow towards your artwork.
            
            In order to generate new ideas, you also need to spend time investigating the experiences you do have. If you are interested in painting a subject, you must go and investigate and experience that subject.
            
            If you want to paint birds, you have to have an understanding of those birds. You must watch how they move, discuss them with knowledgeable professionals, view other artists’ work of the same subject; these are the things that will increase your creativity towards the thing you wish to paint.
            
            Make expanding your horizons a personal policy and standard behavior for yourself. If you see something interesting, go up to investigate and understand what it is in order to develop creativity

One of the reasons we often feel less creative or out of ideas is due to the fact that we aren’t experimenting enough with the ideas that we do have. To learn how to be more creative in art and boost creativity, you have to make things!

When you have a whisper of an idea, no matter how basic, or are inspired by something you have been investigating or experiencing, begin to sketch it out.

Then, experiment with different angles, lighting, and mentally walk around your subject. As you explore, you will find fresh ideas and creative bursts that emerge from the experimentation.

Just like a muscle, to develop creativity you need practice. With regular practice, the creative capacities of our brains can grow and be triggered. Here are a few simple ways that you can develop creativity to form new ideas:

           <p>
             Be different from what is considered "normal". Do not be afraid to ask questions and share your thoughts. You may never know if your ideas are seen as creative by others – thinking creatively is about being outside the box. Let go of any notions that your ideas will be graded, or considered "right" or "wrong". Speak your mind, especially if you think that it’s something you would like to share with others.</p>

            <p>
                If you're tired, there's little point in trying to squeeze out something creative from your head; radical ideas may be less likely to pop into your head when you're drained. Take a nap or a tea break to recharge. You can think better when your mind is fresh, and you should be able to come up with creative ideas more easily.
                Your brain cells need the right amount of glucose to work well. Typically, the ideal amount is about 25 grams. Too little can result in confused thinking, while too much can damage your brain cells.[2] Try snacking on a banana, which has about the right of glucose in it, or eat high fiber carbohydrates (e.g., broccoli or whole-wheat bread) that supply glucose more steadily.[3]
                If you're dehydrated, there will be fewer connections in your brain. This sometimes gives you a feeling of "brain-deadness".</p>

            <p>
               When you are deeply involved with myriad things, you enable yourself to become truly creative. Creativity is about bridging unexpected gaps – for example, taking influences from science and architecture into art.
The Beatles are partially famous because of their ability to bring eastern influences and instruments, like the sitar, into western rock and roll. T famed novelist, David Foster Wallace wrote his masterwork Infinite Jest after years of studying tennis, drug addiction, math, and the science of light and optics.
Travel is a great way to absorb new influences. Go somewhere new and explore your mind for inspiration. If you can't afford to go far, go for a walk and jot down what you see and hear. Alternatively, draw inspiration from a book.

                6.Take some time every day to be creative.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Creativity is not simply innate; it is something that you learn and train every day. No novelist, painter, filmmaker, or musician ever made a career by simply sitting down and letting the ideas flow. They worked at them, learning their craft and coming up with creative ideas every day. Creative ideas only come during creative work – so get working![1]
At first, set aside 20 minutes each day to work on your craft. You can build up to a larger time commitment as you hone your skills.
Even if you don't want to work in a creative field, practicing a creative art (painting, music, etc.) every day can help increase your creativity in everyday life.
